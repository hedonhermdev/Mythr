# MythrConnect
  MythrConnect is a mini social media website that I built for the DVM WinterAssignment task. 
  The project is currently in Phase1 of the task. 
  
 # Project Status
  The following are the essential features I have to implement: 
  - [x] Implement user authentication. Django has a built in auth system and we expect you to use it (it's part of Django's "batteries included" appeal). It's a really handy session based auth system.
  - [x] Create a well defined database structure and then implement it in the models.
  - [] Associate users with a profile. Let users modify their profile data.
  - [x] Allow users to make their own posts and also comment on others' posts (no need to implement commenting on comments).
  - [ ] Allow users to follow each other (hint: you'll need to use many-to-many fields). When you follow other users, make it so that the relavent posts can easily be accessed somewhere (sort of like a news feed).
  - [ ] Make it possible to edit and delete posts. But think about this issue: what if someone posts something offensive and then edits or deletes it.... how would you prevent cyber-crime and cyber-bullying caused by this? (this is an example of where your creativity as a developer will be needed)
